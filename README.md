""SDLC" stands for "Software Development Life Cycle." It is a process that involves several phases to systematically and efficiently create and maintain software. The goal of SDLC is to ensure that the software is developed according to customer requirements and with high quality. Typical phases of the SDLC include:

1. **Planning**: Define the project scope, necessary resources, and timeline.
2. **Requirements Analysis**: Collect and document system requirements from stakeholders.
3. **Design**: Create the software architecture and detailed design that will guide the coding.
4. **Implementation**: Write the code and build the software according to the specified design.
5. **Testing**: Verify that the software works as expected and fix any defects.
6. **Deployment**: Release the software to end users and ensure it is working correctly in a production environment.
7. **Maintenance**: Update and improve the software, fix issues, and add new features as needed.

In the context of: "supporting ongoing efforts to make the client's SDLC fast and efficient while maintaining industry-standard best practices," 

it means that the role includes helping to improve and optimize the entire software development process of the company, ensuring that each phase of the SDLC is carried out efficiently and follows industry best practices to deliver high-quality software. This may involve adopting new tools, agile methodologies, or other practices that can accelerate the development cycle and improve the quality of the final product."
